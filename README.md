# Heart Disease Dataset Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to heart diseases using data science and machine learning techniques. It aims to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential predictors of heart disease from clinical and demographic data.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `dataset.csv`, which contains health records and attributes commonly associated with heart disease.

### Sample Columns (example):
- `age`

- `chol` (serum cholesterol)
- `fbs` (fasting blood sugar)
- `restecg` (resting electrocardiographic results)
- `thalach` (maximum heart rate achieved)
- `target` (presence of heart disease)

> Note: Replace with actual columns if different.
